### Hi there 👋

My name is Andrey and I'm a software developer. Here's what I do: 

- 🌎 With my Motion travel guide [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.machete3845.motion) and [website](https://www.motion.travel/en/about), I'm trying to create the biggest travel guide in the world, with the information about every country on Earth in 25 languages.
- 🗣️ My language-translate app allows user to translate any text in 25 different languages automatically.
- 🔗 My [npm-visualiser](https://github.com/machete38/npm_visualiser) will help you to check NPM dependencies using your phone.
